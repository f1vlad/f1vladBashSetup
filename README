This is used mainly to backup my bash environment setup

Notes:

Currently using the default color scheme, (look for 'colorscheme' on line 190 of .vimrc file)

if you copy the files over, you can type
:colorscheme blackboard
:colorscheme default
:colorscheme ir_black

to toggle through different color schemes
